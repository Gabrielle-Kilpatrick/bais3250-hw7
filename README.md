Thank you for checking out my README page for my first-ever static Azure website. This website is no longer active as the domain name previously used for it has been reallocated to my portfolio website. When this page was active, upon clicking the link it would bring you to a static website in which the Azure logo was visible, with my full name "Gabrielle Kilpatrick" next to said logo.

## What did I learn?
Through this homework project, I've gained new skills that will shape my future usage of GitHub and Azure. 

Firstly, I was introduced to the world of Azure static pages, learning how to create and begin hosting websites efficiently. This experience not only honed my technical abilities but also taught me about the integration of custom domains with web hosting services. 

Secondly, I navigated through the basics of GitHub repository creation, understanding its significance in collaborative development and version control. I learned how to create public repositories and how to link these to Azure web services.

Lastly, I immersed myself in HTML creation, unraveling the fundamental building blocks of web development. From creating accessible webpages to linking various elements, I now possess a solid foundation in web scripting.
