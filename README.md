Thank you for checking out my README page for my first-ever static Azure website. This website is no longer active as the domain name previously used for it has been reallocated to my portfolio website. When this page was active, upon clicking the link it would bring you to a static website in which the Azure logo was visible, with my full name "Gabrielle Kilpatrick" next to said logo.
